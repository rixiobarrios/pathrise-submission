# Pathrise’s Video Submission

## Step 1: Track-Specific Video  
This is your opportunity to showcase your skills and passion related to the industry track you applied for. For this step, we ask you to record a track-specific video as per the instructions outlined below:  

- Data Track: Please complete the problem found here and record a video where you explain your solution, the process you followed, and how you approached the problem.

- Software Engineering (SWE) Track: Solve the following coding problems one and two. Record a video explaining your solutions and your thought process behind them.

- Design/Web Tracks: Record a video walking us through your portfolio or a project that showcases your skills. Explain how you approached the design or web development process and your unique contributions to the project.

- Other Tracks: Record a video walking us through a project that exemplifies the skills in your chosen track. Discuss your role in the project, the challenges you faced, and how you overcame them.

## Step 2: General Video 
In this step, we invite you to record a video where you talk about your background as it relates to your chosen industry track, explain why you're a good fit for Pathrise / feel that Pathrise can support you in your job search, and detail your relevant experiences.

This video will provide us additional context about you and any information that you believe might have been misrepresented or overlooked in your resume. It is also your opportunity to provide additional insights into your motivation and potential.

## Submission Details
For both videos, use a recording service of your choice, such as Loom, Zoom, or your device's built-in screen recording tool, and keep each video to a length of about 3-5 minutes. 

After recording, upload it to a video hosting platform like YouTube, Vimeo, or Google Drive. Please ensure the video settings allow us to view it (public or shared with a link) but make sure it is an unlisted video (i.e., cannot be searched - the direct link has to be shared).

Once your videos are uploaded, fill out the form below and hit “submit”. 

Put your track-specific video in the “Track-Specific Video” field and your general video in the “General Video” field.

We ask you to submit your videos within the next 7 days. We're looking forward to getting to know you better and giving your application further consideration! We will follow up 1 week after receiving the video with next steps.

Be genuine, be passionate, and most importantly, be yourself. We look forward to hearing your story. 

Good luck!
